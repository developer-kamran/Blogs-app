Welcome to Django Crash Course! In this blog post, we will cover the basics of Django, a powerful web framework written in Python. Whether you're a seasoned Python developer or just starting out, Django is a great choice for building web applications quickly and efficiently.

What is Django?

Django is a free and open-source web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is designed to simplify the process of building web applications by providing a set of tools and conventions for handling common tasks such as database access, URL routing, and form handling.

One of the key features of Django is its robust Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, which allows you to interact with databases using Python code instead of SQL. This makes it easy to create, read, update, and delete data in your application without having to write complex SQL queries.
